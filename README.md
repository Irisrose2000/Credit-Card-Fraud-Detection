# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Random Forest

This project implements a fraud detection system using machine learning. The model uses the Random Forest Classifier to predict fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, so SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to address the class imbalance.

### Task Objectives:
- Train a Random Forest Classifier on the dataset.
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Evaluate model performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
